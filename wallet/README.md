From here, you have several options with your Ethereum. You can deposit Ethereum directly into your wallet for safekeeping. Additionally, you have the flexibility to wrap a specific amount of your ETH into FETH, choosing from preset percentages like 25%, 50%, or even 100% of your ETH holdings. It's also possible to reveal your wallet's private key, although this should be done with caution as it grants full access to your funds.
