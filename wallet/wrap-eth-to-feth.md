# üîÑ Wrap ETH to FETH

#### Wrapping ETH into FETH

1. Click **Wrap X ETH to FETH**.
2. Enter the amount of ETH you wish to wrap into FETH. Options include typing the exact amount or selecting a percentage (25%, 50%, 100%).
3. &#x20;The transaction minimizes gas fees! If you choose a percentage, it calculates to leave a minimum of 0.01 ETH in your balance to cover future gas fees. This is not a service fee, but a feature to prevent your wallet from being completely depleted.
   * Example: Wrapping 100% of 100 ETH results in receiving 99.99 FETH, keeping 0.01 ETH for gas
