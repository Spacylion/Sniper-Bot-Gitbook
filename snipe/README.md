1. You are then prompted to type in a token address for the token you'd like to snipe.
2. The bot will check if this token exists on Facet scan. If the token does not exist, you will see an error message!
3. Carefully review the token details displayed on your screen to ensure it matches the specifics of the token you intend to snipe. This includes verifying the tokenâ€™s name, symbol, and total supply.
4. Your ETH and FETH balances, along with your FETH wallet address, are shown. Ensure you have sufficient funds for the transaction.
5. The **Buy Min** and **Buy Max** settings influence the minimum and maximum amount you can spend on a purchase. You can adjust these values in the settings menu. If left as is, the system will use default values.&#x20;
